How?
===
there is no magic,i just know ViewPager could add PageChangeListener,with the callback we could get the ViewPager's current item showing and the page scroll offset([0,1)),so we can move the circle corresponding to the ViewPager's scroll<br>

Usage
===
support three alignment:LEFT,CENTER and RIGHT
and there is some attributes below:<br>
bubble_mode: background,overlay<br>
bubble_gravity:left,center,right<br>
numer:the circle's quantity<br>
radius : circle radius<br>
gap:the space between circles
